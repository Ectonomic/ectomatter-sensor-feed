//! Every sensor Ectomatter can read on this computer, for the Sensors box in Settings: found
//! under `root` (`/` but for tests), sorted into the parts of the computer the box has a tab
//! for (the processor, graphics, memory, the motherboard, a laptop's battery and its own
//! controller, drives, network), and named as people say them where Ectomatter knows what a
//! sensor reads (k10temp's Tccd1 is Chiplet 1, a drive's Composite is its Temperature), the
//! driver's own name kept beside it. Elsewhere the driver's name is used.
//!
//! A sensor is kept by what Linux calls it: its driver, the device it reads and its label
//! (`k10temp@0000:00:18.3/temp/Tctl`). The device is a PCI address, a platform device's
//! name, a memory stick's place on its bus or a drive's serial number; the number Linux gives
//! an hwmon at start-up can change between boots, so it is never part of one. The readings
//! Ectomatter works out itself have names of their own: `cpu/load`, `cpu/clock/average`,
//! `memory/used`, and a graphics card's `card@0000:01:00.0/temperature`.
